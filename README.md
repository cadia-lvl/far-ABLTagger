# Faroese ABLTagger API
This is an API for [far-ABLTagger](https://github.com/cadia-lvl/far-ABLTagger) using the [ELG specification](https://european-language-grid.readthedocs.io/en/stable/all/A3_API/LTInternalAPI.html#basic-api-pattern).
The API is wrapped in a [docker container](https://www.docker.com/) and is implemented using [fastapi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi).

# Getting started
```bash
make build
make run
```

# API calls
All the API calls use post and input/outputs are in a json format.
Further details about the api calls are automatically generated when the container is run and can be found in /docs or /redoc

| HTTP METHOD | Description |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| /tag_simple | Takes in Faroese text and returns ABLTags for each token in the text |

# Testing
test files can be found in `tests/`. There are two tests that can be performed.
1. Normal api tests: this is where you test the api from the running docker image
2. ELG api tests: this is where you run `docker-compose up` and get an instance as if you where running the docker image on ELG. To submit a api call you then need to send a post request to `/process/service`.

# Underlying tools
The underlying tagger is [Faroese implementation of ABLTagger](https://github.com/cadia-lvl/far-ABLTagger) by [Hinrik Hafsteinsson](https://github.com/hinrikur). This [updated version](https://github.com/cadia-lvl/far-ABLTagger/tree/elg-standard) of the tool is copied into the docker image when it is built. 

The [Tokenizer](https://github.com/mideind/Tokenizer) [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/tokenizer/) is pip installed when the docker image is built. This tool was developed by [Mi√∞eind](https://mideind.is/) and is licensed under this [MIT](https://github.com/mideind/Tokenizer/blob/master/LICENSE) license.
